# README

[Seaside](http://seaside.bryanfowler.io) is an [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/) inspired single page application. Seaside is built with a Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL backend. On the frontend, Seaside utilizes the React JavaScript library and the Redux state management cycle.

## Functional Summary

This section will provide a high level overview of Seaside's functionality. 

When using Seaside, users may search for available boats throughout the world using an integrated Google Maps API and a geoencoded search bar. Boats are filterable based on location, price and number of guests. Users may book boats by navigating to the boat's show page, selecting the desired dates and clicking "Request Booking". Bookings are automatically approved if another booking does not overlap. After booking, users may leave reviews on the boat. Ratings and comments will immediately be reflected on the boat's show page.
